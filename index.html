				<p> Hi, I am Allysson Allan de Farias. <a href="https://forebears.io/surnames/farias">The surname has a

						<h2>Who I am</h2>
						<p>I was born in Brazil, where I took my undergraduate degree in biology at the State University
							of
							Paraiba (2006–2010) with master’s in archaeology at the Federal University of Pernambuco
							(2011–2013), and a doctoral degree in genetics at the University of Sao Paulo (2014–2018).
							Currently, I am working close to population medical genetics, collaborating as Senior
							Bioinformatician at the State University of Paraiba since 2014, who handle genomic data to
							teach programming languages, and investigate recessive autosomal diseases and the
							demographic
							history of admixed populations. Also, I had two more positions as postdoctoral researcher at the Università degli Studi di Padova (2020-2021)
							investigating polygenic risk scores in admixed populations, and Fundação Oswaldo Cruz working with metagenomics and emerging pathogens (2023).

						<h2>Which skills I have</h2>
						<p>As expected for a good researcher, I am resilient. One part of my skills is based on the search
							for funding agencies, collaborating in many research groups from diverse
							institutions in Brazil and overseas. Another
							part is inside the scientific and professional career, what enabled me to handle the huge amount of data from
							biobanks and population genetic databases (<a href="#two">What I do</a>); each research
							question raised from different groups upgraded my programming skills, I am frequently
							investigating how to
							interpret the genomic data from Brazilian tri-hybrid population and nowadays I see myself diving
							in ancient DNA stuff (human, sediments and pathogens).</p>

						<h2>What I am looking for</h2>
						<p>My desire is to unpick how humans have moved and evolved, uncovering some disease evidences during these
							processes of change. I am interested in past key events to draw a picture of the human population 
							diversity, to see how they relate to people living in recently admixed populations;
							being not completely past-addicted, I am also interested in AI and healthcare, 
							always eager to learn new technologies and stay current on the latest advancements</p>

				<h2>What I do</h2>
				<p>I began my career in Bioinformatics during my undergraduate classes in production engineering
					at Federal University of Campina Grande (2006) while I was studying biology in parallel. My
					first language was Fortran much oriented to mathematics. Also, during the engineering
					course, I practiced C with the same orientation. Then occurred the interruption of the
					engineering path to exclusively follow the Biology course at the State University of Paraiba,
					my alma mater. <br> Large experience with three HPC clusters (
					(Sun) Human Genome and Stem-Cell Research Center at the University of Sao Paulo, (Rocket) University of Tartu, 
					(Carlos Chagas) Aggeu Magalhaes Institute - Fiocruz).
					I am collaborating with a research group from the State University of Paraiba as Senior
					Bioinformatician since 2008.
					I worked as a Principal AI Lab and Analytics Specialist at Farmácias Pague Menos, 
					the second largest retail pharmacy company in Brazil. 
					I successfully led a data-driven team that exceeded annual milestones, developing applications 
					and insights to enhance company performance. I also have experience as a Data Scientist at 
					Hospital Albert Einstein and Hapvida Saúde, where I contributed to key performance indicators in healthcare.
					<br>My last position was Bioinformatics Manager at Fiocruz - CE, where
					I lead a team of bioinformaticians and developers to deliver innovative solutions for the healthcare sector. 
					We use the latest technologies in distributed systems, data pipelines, and large-scale data processing 
					to develop products based on machine learning and predictive models. 
					<br>My goal is to apply my diverse skill set to improve public health.
					I have a strong background in bioinformatics, with a PhD in Genetics from Universidade de São Paulo and 
					over 15 years of experience in research and scientific writing.</p>
